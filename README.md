# Fast-Food-Chain-Management
“Fast Food Chain Management”  during the academic session 2016-17 in Father Agnel School,Delhi


This is a c++ project made using concepts of Object Oriented Programming


This project is about automating a fast food restaurant. 
	After installing the project we need to generate the item codes of the items to be sold in the restaurant.The codes are automatically 
  generated  by the system which reduces the risk of duplicate codes.
	Once the codes are generated,  we add the stock to be  kept in the"restaurant. After the items are added in the stock, now the system
	is ready to raise the bills. While  raising the bills,  the system automatically deducts the sold quantity from the stock.  Hence the";
	system keeps a track of the inventory also. 
  As far as reports are concerned,one can see item list, stock in hand and the total sales
	cout<<"of the restaurant till date.
